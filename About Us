Oquotes is an android app which runs on react native for now.
Oquotes is a quotes app with card swiper view . You can see new cards (quotes ) by scrolling to the right or left.
Oquotes contains quotes from legends, novelist, scientist and other famous people.
Oquotes contains different categories of quotes such as; motivational, emotional, etc. 
With Oquotes you can easily access any quotes rather than going through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

In future, we are looking to add a feature on the app in which you can add a quote of yours or one which isn't there. 
We also looking at link Oquotes to the Steem blockchain. 
User quotes added to Oquotes will be automatically linked to their steemit page. 
In this way you can make a profit from the quotes you add by upvotes of Steemians who like and reads the quote. 
(You can think of Oquotes like Dlive, Utopian or Busy.)
